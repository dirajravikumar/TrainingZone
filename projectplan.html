<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>The Training Zone web site is intended to increase revenue for Traning Zone by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat customers.</p>

<h3>Success Evaluation</h3>

<p>Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>

<p>Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at.</p>
